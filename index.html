										<h5>...highly expressive <br> and elegant code.</h5>
										<hr>
										<p>I am a designer with a business-first mentality. I will not optimize a process before it even needs optimization.<br>
										In developing, I prioritize my focus on the areas which have the biggest impact on your business.</p>

										<h5>...the most optimal tool <br> for the job.</h5>
										<hr>
										<p>I use just 2 <a href="#">languages</a>, and a handful of <a href="#">web frameworks</a>. Surprisingly, I can do most jobs with just those tools.<br>
										What I can't guarantee, is that the tool I choose will be the most optimal one for the job.
										What I carry is a swiss army knife.
										The website’s performance won’t suffer, but the code's logic may be less intuitive.</p>

								<h2>What I <em>can</em> o for you</h2>
								<p>Most of my experience comes in working for startups. I have had to develop a very diverse skill-set while working for these companies. This has led me to spotting and executing on opportunities which would have otherwise been passed over. What I bring to the table, is my understanding of the big picture at a high level, and my intuition for knowing where potential business-impacting opportunities lay. <br><br>
								I am not just a web developer. <br>I am a consultant for web presence.

								<h2>Responsive</h2>
								<p>Your website will be made with a mobile-first mentality. The clients of a typical <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp" target="_blank">B2C</a> business will access the company website from a mobile phone more than 50% of the time. This makes mobile optimization critical for a presence on the web.</p>

								<h2>Dynamic</h2>
								<p>If necessary, your website will be able to get data from a database and display it in the webpage. Think sites like Amazon, which has a <em>products page</em>, or Facebook which has a <em>profile page</em>. All users have their own versions of these pages, which come from the same template. Data is simply <em>dynamically</em> added in from a database.</p>

								<h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
								<p>In the world of Google, how we design our websites has an impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). We are better off if we design our websites with the search engine in mind. If we want to get in Google's good graces, we'd better take its implications seriously during the design phase.</p>

								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon business"></span>
									<h3>Business First</h3>
									<p>A website's role is to support your business. Everything will be designed around that purpose. I will not spend development hours trying to shave 30 milliseconds off of load time, if there are pages of the site that are not aesthetically pleasing.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon communication"></span>
									<h3>Communication</h3>
									<p>Programming is a very a deep field. As such, programmers tend to immerse themselves in the world, making it easy to forget that most of the world does not. I believe strongly that how well a piece of business went has a high correlation to how well it was communicated.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon modular"></span>
									<h3>Modular Design</h3>
									<p>Code will be structured in such a way that components can plug into each other like lego. This makes the code easier to understand, and easier to scale.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon grandfathered"></span>
									<h3>Grandfathered Rates</h3>
									<p>The very nature of web design suggests there will be maintenance. Appropriately, I expect to have a long term relationship with my clients. For all projects, I charge a single hourly rate throughout. </p>
									<!-- (add question mark with tooltip). Major revisions are subject to discussion. -->
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon reports"></span>
									<h3>Weekly Progress Reporting</h3>
									<p>I track my time very closely and take note of specifically where my development hours are spent. This information, among others, is summarized in a weekly report. I try to be as non-technical as possible, so we can make any necessary adjustments to the development process.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon advice"></span>
									<h3>Advice on Technical Decisions</h3>
									<p>I take an interest in all my client's work. As such, I am always on the lookout for tech-related opportunities. Throughout the development process, I will communicate technological opportunities that may present themselves.</p>
