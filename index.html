											<p>I consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface" target="_blank">UI</a> and <a
													href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" target="_blank">UX</a> decisions to be among the most
												important of web design. My preferred strategy is to deconstruct components of well-designed sites, and morph them
												to form an entirely new one.<br>I’m here for functionality, not originality.</p>

									<div>
										<h5>...highly expressive <br> and elegant code.</h5>
										<hr>
										<p>I am a designer with a business-first mentality. I will not optimize a process before it even needs optimization.<br> In developing, I prioritize my focus on the areas which have the biggest impact on your business.</p>

										<h5>...the most optimal tool <br> for the job.</h5>
										<hr>
										<p>I use just 2 <a href="#">languages</a>, and a handful of <a href="#">web frameworks</a>. Surprisingly, I can do most jobs with just those tools.<br> What I can't guarantee, is that the tool I choose will be the most optimal one for the job.
										What I carry is a swiss army knife.
										The website’s performance won’t suffer, but the code's logic may be less intuitive to other developers.</p>

							<h2>What I <em>can</em> do for you</h2>
							<p>Most of my experience comes in working for startups. I have had to develop a very diverse skill-set while working
								for these companies. This has led me to spotting and executing on opportunities which would have otherwise been
								passed over. What I bring to the table, is my understanding of the big picture at a high level, and my intuition for knowing where potential business-impacting opportunities lay. <br><br> I am not just a web developer. <br> I am a consultant for web presence.

								<h2>Business-First</h2>
								<p>Your website’s purpose is to support your business. At the heart of this, is the experience that your users have while visiting (UX). First and foremost, visitors <em>must</em> get what they came for, and must have as seamless an experience as possible. <br><br> This is the heart of my development philosophy. <br><br> I do not spend development hours trying to shave off 30 milliseconds of page load time. Instead, I prioritize tasks that directly impact the experience of your users.</p>

								<h2>Communication</h2>
								<p>Communication is at the heart of any business arrangement: one party communicates to the other what goals they expect to achieve. <br><br> Programming is a very a deep field, and programmers tend to immerse themselves in that world. This makes it easy to forget that most people do not. Communication has a massive impact on how smoothly business goes. This makes it one of the core tenets of my practice.</p>

								<h2>Weekly Progress Reporting</h2>
								<p>I track my time very closely and take note of specifically where my development hours are spent. I summarize this and other information in a weekly report. I try to be as non-technical as possible, in order to allow you to retain control of the development process.</p>

								<h2>Philosophies</h2>

							<ul class="features">
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon responsive"></span>
									<h3>Responsive</h3>

									<p>Your website will be made with a mobile-first mentality. The clients of a typical <a
										href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp" target="_blank">B2C</a> business will access the company website
									from a mobile phone more than 50% of the time. This makes mobile optimization critical for a presence on the web.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon dynamic"></span>
									<!-- <img src="./images/icons/dynamic.svg" alt=""> -->
									<h3>Dynamic</h3>
									<p>If necessary, your website will be able to get data from a database and display it in the webpage. Think sites like
										Amazon, which has a <em>products page</em>, or Facebook which has a <em>profile page</em>. All users have their own
										versions of these pages, which come from the same template. Data is simply <em>dynamically</em> added in from a
										database.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon modular"></span>
									<h3>Modular Design</h3>
									<p>Code will be structured in such a way that components can plug into each other like lego. This makes the code easier to understand, and easier to scale.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon grandfathered"></span>
									<h3>Grandfathered Rates</h3>
									<p>The very nature of web design suggests there will be maintenance. Appropriately, I expect to have a long term relationship with my clients. For all projects, I charge a single hourly rate throughout. </p>
									<!-- (add question mark with tooltip). Major revisions are subject to discussion. -->
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon reports"></span>
									<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
									<p>In the world of Google, how we design our websites has an impact on SEO (Search Engine Optimization). We are better
										off if we design our websites with the search engine in mind. If we want to get in Google's good graces, we'd better
										take its implications seriously during the design phase.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="philosophy-icon advice"></span>
									<h3>Advice on Technical Decisions</h3>
									<p>I take an interest in all my client's work. As such, I am always on the lookout for tech-related opportunities. Throughout the development process, I will communicate technological opportunities that may present themselves.</p>
