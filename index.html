								<h2>Responsive web design</h2>
								<p>Your website will be made with a mobile-first mentality. For most B2C businesses, more than half of page visits are made from a mobile device. If your website does not perform well for these users, there is a good chance they will not return. Further to this, Google has announced that its web crawlers will use the mobile version of all websites for determining which ones appear at the top of the results.</p>

								<h2>Dynamic</h2>
								<p>If necessary, your website will be able to get data from a database and display it in the browser. Think sites like Amazon, which have a "products page". This is more or less only a template with data filled-in from database.</p>

								<h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
								<p>Before writing a single line of code, it is imperative that we spend a fair amount of time doing keyword research around your particular offering. Google is the principal way in which people seek answers to their questions. This makes it absolutely imperative that your *answer* appears right on the first page.</p>

								<h2>Business First</h2>
								<p>At the end of the day a website is supposed to support your business. For this reason, everything will be designed around that purpose. I will not spend development hours trying to shave off 30 milliseconds of load time, if there are pages of the site that are not asetically pleasing. </p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon far fa-comments">
									<h3>Communication</h3>
									<p>Development is a deep field, and as such it easy to get lost and forget that people specialize in different areas. As a former business-centric person who has hired developers in the past, I understand first-hand how this can create countless problems down the road. I make it among my primary goals to be an effective communicator, no matter your background. </p>
								</li>
								<!-- <li class="icon fab fa-buffer"> -->
								<li class="icon fab fa-codepen">
									<h3>Modular Design</h3>
									<p>I will design your website in a modular way, meaning components of the site will plug in to each other like lego. This allows your site to respond well to scaling, as bottleneck components can be more easily swapped out for more permitting ones</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fas fa-dollar-sign">
									<h3>Grandfathered Rates</h3>
									<p>The very nature of web design means there will be maintenance. As a result, I expect to have a long term relationship with my clients. For each project, I charge a single hourly rate throughout. Major changes are subject to discussion</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fas fa-clipboard">
									<h3>Weekly Progress Reporting</h3>
									<p>Estimating the time it takes to program something is notoriously difficult. For this reason, I send detailed regular reports outlining the work I have done for the period and how many hours I have spent so far. This should prevent any surprises when it comes to updates, and will give you a better idea of where you think development time would be best spent..</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fas fa-book-reader">
									<h3>Learning</h3>
									<p>If there comes a time that I am forced to learn an entirely new technology while working on your website, I will only invoice at 50% of my going rate.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fas fa-user-friends">
									<h3>Advice on Technical Decisions</h3>
									<p>At the end of the day, this is your ship and you are free to steer it whichever direction you choose. However, I will serve as your advisor, and I will make my opinion known if I feel strongly about it. You can take this advice or leave it, but you can be sure that I will bring it up.</p>
